(* 2 ^ (log_base_2 n) = n


  Tests: 

      1. log_base_2 1 = 0
      2. log_base_2 2 = 1
      3. log_base_2 3 = 1
      4. log_base_2 4 = 2

      6. log_base_2 6 = 2
      7. log_base_2 7 = 2
      8. log_base_2 8 = 3

      Requires: 
      n <> Zero 

      Ensures:

(* Operations: *)

(*

  1. If n is one, then return zero
  2. Else, say m = div n two. 
  3. Compute (log_base_2 m). 
          Then: 2^(log_base_2 m) <= m < 2^((log_base_2 m) + 1).
          That is: 2^((log_base_2 m) + 1) <= n < 2^((log_base_2 m) + 2)
  4. Return Succ (log_base_2 m)

(* Proof: *)

(* Exercise. 

    Induction on n. 

    For n = Zero, it doesn't satisfy the requires clause
    For n = Succ Zero, that is the base case. 

    For n > 1, ... 

    IH: If n' <> Zero, then 2^(log_base_2 n') <= n' < 2^((log_base_2 n') + 1)

(* Case Study IX: The Y2K Bug (2000)

In the 20th century, many systems stored years using only two digits 
(e.g., "99"). As the year rolled over to "00", systems misinterpreted it as 
1900 instead of 2000. This caused widespread concern about banking, airline 
systems, etc.

Looking ahead, in the year 2038 we can expect another problem. Many UNIX-like 
systems represent time as a 32-bit signed integer. This overflows on Jan 19, 
2038, at 03:14:07 UTC. After that, the integer "wraps around" to a negative 
number, corrupting time data. This is the 32-bit equivalent of the Y2K bug.

(* Case Study X: Bitcoin's Value Overflow Incident (2010)

A bug in Bitcoin's transaction validation allowed an output value to overflow.
A transaction created ~184 billion BTC out of thin air â€” far above the intended
cap. Root Cause: Integer overflow due to unchecked addition of 64-bit integers. 
Fixed by a hard fork that reversed the transaction and patched the validation 
logic.
