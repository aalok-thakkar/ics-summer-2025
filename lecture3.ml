let rec nat_to_int (n : nat) : int =

  | Zero -> 0
  | Succ k -> 1 + nat_to_int k

(* We want to prove: nat_to_int (plus k n) = (nat_to_int k) + (nat_to_int n) *)

let rec int_to_nat (n: int) : nat = 
  match n with 
  | 0 -> Zero
  | m when (m > 0) -> Succ (int_to_nat (m - 1))
  | _ -> Zero


(* nat_to_int (int_to_nat n) = n ?
  int_to_nat (nat_to_int n) = n ? 

*)




(* Proof by induction on k:

  Base case: k = Zero
    plus Zero n = n
    nat_to_int (plus Zero n) = nat_to_int n
    nat_to_int Zero + nat_to_int n = 0 + nat_to_int n = nat_to_int n

  Inductive step: Assume true for k = k2
    plus (Succ k2) n = Succ (plus k2 n)
    nat_to_int (plus (Succ k2) n) = nat_to_int (Succ (plus k2 n))
                        = 1 + nat_to_int (plus k2 n)
    By induction hypothesis:
     nat_to_int (plus k2 n) = nat_to_int k2 + nat_to_int n
    So,
     nat_to_int (plus (Succ k2) n) = 1 + (nat_to_int k2 + nat_to_int n)
                         = (1 + nat_to_int k2) + nat_to_int n
                         = nat_to_int (Succ k2) + nat_to_int n

  Therefore, by induction, the denotational semantics of plus matches integer 
  addition.

(* Proof of correctness of addition using axiomatic semantics:

    To prove that addition is correct, we need to show that it satisfies the 
    following properties: 
    
    1. Zero is the identity element for addition.
    2. The successor of a natural number n is the result of adding one to n.

    Succ (n) = plus (Succ Zero) n
*)


(* How do we define subtraction? *)

(* 
    Subtraction is not defined for all natural numbers, as it can lead to 
    negative results. However, we can define subtraction in a way that it only 
    returns a natural number if the result is non-negative. We can define 
    subtraction recursively as follows:

    - For any natural number n, subtracting Zero gives n.
    - For any natural number n, subtracting Succ k gives minus k n if n is 
      greater than Succ k, otherwise Zero.

(* Dry Run 

    minus (Succ (Succ (Succ Zero))) (Succ Zero)
  = minus Succ (Succ (Zero)) Zero
  = minus Succ (Succ (Zero))

    minus (Succ Zero) (Succ (Succ (Succ Zero))) 
  = minus (Zero) (Succ (Succ (Zero)))
  = Zero
*)

(* How do we define multiplication? *)

(* 
    Multiplication can be defined recursively as follows:
    - For any natural number n, multiplying by Zero gives Zero.
    - For any natural number n, multiplying by Succ k gives n + (n * k). *)
    
let rec mult (n : nat) (m : nat) : nat =

  (* mult Succ (n') m = plus (mult n' m) m *)




(* How do we define division? *)

(* 
    Division can be defined recursively as follows:
    - For any natural number n, dividing by Zero is undefined.
    - For any natural number n, dividing by Succ k gives the largest natural 
    number m such that m * (Succ k) <= n.

(* Division is especially difficult to define correctly. *)

(* Case Study IV: Pentium FDIV bug (1994)

    In 1994, a bug in the Pentium processor's floating-point division unit 
    caused incorrect results in some calculations. The bug was caused by a 
    hardware error in the division unit. The bug was not detected until 1996, 
    when it was discovered that the bug was causing incorrect results in some 
    calculations. 

    In particular, dividing 4,195,835 by 3,145,727 gave 1.33382
    instead of the correct result of 1.33373.

    Intel said it incurred "a $475 million pre-tax charge ... to recover 
    replacement and write-off of these microprocessors."

(* Our code ends with an exception as soon as one is raised! The same will

(* We instead want to support a way to handle exceptions well. *)

(* Case Study VI: USS Yorktown (CG-48).

In 1996, the U.S. Navy's Smart Ship initiative, aiming to automate key key 
operations and cut crew costs by 10% and save an estimated $2.8 million annually, 
decided to use a Windows NT 4.0-based network to manage vital functions like 
navigation, engine monitoring, and fuel control. 

However, during maneuvers in 1997, a crew member input a zero into a database, 
triggering a division-by-zero error in the Remote Database Manager (RDM).  

Since other Smart Ship systems were dependent on RDM availability across the 
LAN, these other SMCS components including ones controlling the motor and 
propulsion machinery began to fail in a domino-like sequence until the ship 
stopped dead in the water.

(* For handling exceptions, we will use option types! Option types in OCaml 
represent values that may or may not be present. They are defined as 

    type 'a option = None | Some of 'a' where 

'a' is any type. This is useful for functions that may not return a valid 
result, such as division by zero.

(* What about the remainder? *)




(* But we need a quotient and a remainder. Let us first figure out how we can 
have a function that has two outputs. *)  

(* A tuple is a fixed-size collections of values. For example, a pair of values
written as (a, b), but tuples can have more elements, e.g., (a, b, c).

  Example: A pair of integers
    let p : int * int = (3, 4)

  Example: A triple of different types
    let t : int * string * bool = (42, "hello", true)

  Accessing tuple elements is usually done via pattern matching:
    let (x, y) = p in
    (* x = 3, y = 4 *) 

*)

let min_max (a : int) (b : int) : int * int =
  match (a < b) with
  | true -> (a, b)
  | false -> (b, a) 


let min_max (a : int) (b : int) : int * int =
  match (a, b) with
  | (x, y) when x < y -> (a, b)
  | _ -> (b, a)


(* Now we can define a function that returns both the quotient and the 
remainder of a division operation. *)


let rec divmod (n: nat) (m: nat) : (nat * nat) option = 
  match (n, m) with 
  | (_, Zero) -> None
  | (Zero, _) -> Some (Zero, Zero)
  | (_, _) -> 
    match (safe_minus_nat n m) with 
    | None -> Some (Zero, n)
    | Some diff ->
      match divmod diff m with 
      | None -> None
      | Some (q', r') -> Some (Succ q', r')


    (* Say, previous division gave me None. Then just do None. 
            previous division gave me Some(q' r'). 
            q = Succ q'
            r = r'  
    *)



(* Prove the correctness of division, that is prove that: *)
(* 

divmod n m = Some (q, r) iff n = plus (mult m q) r
and divmod n m = None iff m = Zero. 

This requires the proof of correctness of safe_minus, as well as induction on 
both n and m.

First prove that:
    
    if (n <= m),    safe_minus n m = Some r 
    else,           safe_minus n m = None

    Use Induction on n as well as m. Here is a sketch:

    Base Case:  n = Zero, then safe_minus Zero m = None  (by definition)
                m = Zero, then safe_minus n Zero = n     (by definition)

    Induction Hypothesis: Assume safe_minus n' m' is correct for all n' < n, 
    m' < m.
    
    Inductive Step: By definition, for n = Succ n' and m = Succ m', 
    
        safe_minus (Succ n') (Succ m') = safe_minus n' m'.
        
        By the inductive hypothesis, safe_minus n' m' is correct, so 
        safe_minus (Succ n') (Succ m') is also correct.
*)





(*  Then prove:

    divmod n m = Some (q,r) iff n = plus (mult m q) r and (m <> Zero)
    
    Here is a sketch for your reference. This is an incomplete proof. Attempt 
    to write it down. First let us get rid of the case of m = Zero. Then, 
    focus on m <> Zero.
    
    Proof by Induction on n:
    
    Base Case: n = Zero. This case can be completed by definition.
                    
            So for all m <> Zero, divmod Zero m = Some (Zero, Zero)

    Induction Hypothesis: 

            For all n' < n, 
                for all m <> Zero, divmod n' m = Some (q, r) iff 
                  n = plus (mult m q) r

    Induction Step: 

        If safe_minus n m = None, then ...
        If safe_minus n m = Some diff, then consider (divmod diff m).
            It must be the case that (divmod diff m) = Some (q, r)          
            (In which case apply Induction Hypothesis)
